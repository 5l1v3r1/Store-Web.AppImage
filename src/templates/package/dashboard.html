                <p>At 05:40 Linus highlights application packaging:</p>

                <i> We basically don&#39;t make binaries for Linux. Why?
                    Because binaries for Linux desktop applications is a major f*ing pain in the ass.
                    Right. You don&#39;t make binaries for Linux.
                    You make binaries for Fedora 19, Fedora 20, maybe there&#39;s even like RHEL 5 from ten years ago,
                    you make binaries for debian stable.
                </i>

                <p>So why not use the same approach as on Windows and OS X, namely, treat the base operating system as a&nbsp;<em>platform</em>&nbsp;on
                    top of which we run the application we care about. This means that we have to bundle the application
                    with all their dependencies that are&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;part of the base operating system [<a
                            href="https://docs.appimage.org/introduction/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">appimage.org</a>].
                </p>
                <p>At the same time the package-managers are extremely useful and getting rid of them is a huge
                    regression in terms of usability from my point of view. With this project i am trying to combine the
                    approaches from the both of the worlds providing the AppImage repository and the command line
                    package
                    manager to install / uninstall and provide the system integration of the available AppImage.</p>

                <h3 class="header">What is AppImage</h3>
                <p class="caption">
                    AppImage provides a way for upstream developers to provide “native” binaries for Linux users just
                    the same way they could do for other operating systems. It allow packaging applications for any
                    common Linux based operating system, e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, openSUSE, RHEL, CentOS, Fedora etc.
                    AppImages come with all dependencies that cannot be assumed to be part of each target system in a
                    recent enough version and will run on most Linux distributions without further modifications [<a
                        href="https://docs.appimage.org/introduction/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">appimage.org</a>].

                <h3 class="header">Why would I as a user want to use AppImages?</h3>
                <p class="caption">
                <ul class="collection">
                    <li class="collection-item">"I as a user want to run the latest version of my favorite app on my
                        stable distribution, which ships only with an old outdated version."
                    </li>
                    <li class="collection-item">"I as a user need to use multiple versions of an application in
                        parallel."
                    </li>
                    <li class="collection-item">"I as a user want to take my favorite applications with me on a portable
                        disk together with my data, allowing me to use any Linux computer to work with my files."
                    </li>
                    <li class="collection-item">"I am in a corporate or university environment and want to simply run
                        some specific software, but lack permissions to ‘install’ applications."
                    </li>
                </ul>

                All these use cases can be accomplished by using AppImages. They’re a trade-off between a simple user
                experience and resulting file size. The unique user experience guarantees that even less tech-savvy
                people can get started without any major issues. AppImage is primarily a user-focused way of bundling
                software.
